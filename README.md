# Restaurant Reviews App

## Introduction.

This is a project for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer
Nanodegree program. The objective of the project is to 
take an app that is not working very well and make it fully
responsive and accessible to users for all type of devices. 
App should also be able to work when network connection
is down or poor.


## Running the App

* Using Python HTTP server
In the project folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

1. Using Terminal enter into project directory.

2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`.

  * a If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.)
  * b For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 3000`.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:3000`.
